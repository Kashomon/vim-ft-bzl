A rudimentary [Bazel](http://bazel.io) filetype plugin. Provides syntax files
and basic settings for the bzl filetype and detection rules for bzl files.

**NOTE**: As of vim 8.0.0164, these files have been merged into vim's upstream
runtime files. You only need this plugin if you're running an older version of
vim, or to receive future updates until they're merged into vim.
